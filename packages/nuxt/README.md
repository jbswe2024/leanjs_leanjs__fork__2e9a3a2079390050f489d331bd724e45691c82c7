# @leanjs/nuxt

## Installation

`yarn add @leanjs/nuxt @leanjs/vue @leanjs/core`

## Limitations

Due to the nature of nuxt, we currently cannot support microfrontends that manage multiple routes in nuxt.

While we believe this is an unusual scenario, it is nonetheless a feature we'd like to add in the future.
